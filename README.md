## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Backend professional with frontend experience.
Enthusiast and curious about new technologies and good practices.

I'm a Systems Analyst and I have performed in several companies for the last seventeen years. I've started with relational databases mostly until I've co-founded for a couple of years a society where we build software solutions for different customers and started to learn and gain more confidence in the technologies that I'm still using now.

I've recently certified AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner and my goal is to continue the learning path to developer and devops.
